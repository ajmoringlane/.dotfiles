"This lab was alright, I originally got stuck on the VIM interface. After googling it, I realized i needed to hit escape to be able to use commands. I then needed to use :wq to save and actually see my changes. Other issue was when I had to copy it into a text file. I had to use cp .vimrc ~/Desktop/username_lab02_guided.txt to get it to work. Still learning the little things, like how i am typing in a comment. Aside from those issues, lab wasnt bad.
